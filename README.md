# Warning
> [!WARNING]
> Household appliances work with high voltages and currents. They generate heat and steam, they shake, vibrate and have rotating parts. You should have a good knowledge of electrics and take appropriate safety measures before opening or modifying such an appliance. Parts can get wet or hot, move or fall off.

> [!WARNING]
> Even if parts of the appliances operate at low voltages, depending on your specific model they may or may not be isolated from earth. This is a good chance of death or serious injury.
> I'm not responsible if you kill your cat, your spouse, your favourite pet fish, or yourself, whichever of these is the worst for you. You have been warned.
